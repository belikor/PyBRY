    What needs to be done is the following

    An API Wrapper for LBRY.io needs to be made in order to make requests to the API

    The only two examples I've seen both were making requests to the authorized-api, which
    required a username and a password. Since this is sort of confusing and not very
    test-friendly if you want to make requests without having a username and password


    basic idea is as follows: we need to make a POST request to a given URL,
    with a 'method' (api function), and the parameters we give it.

    We want to be able to continuously make requests if we need to, and so we will
    encapsulate this as a class
